What's new for OMERO 5.6 for sysadmins
======================================

- :doc:`version-requirements` has been updated to reflect changes in
  version support for 5.6.0 and tentative plans for 6.0.0. The biggest
  change is of course the removal of support for Python 2.

- Installation walkthroughs now all suggest use of a virtualenv for
  installing Python packages. The upgrade guides will help with the
  migration. See :doc:`python3-migration` for more information.

- See `the previous What's new page <https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/omero/5.5/sysadmins/whatsnew.html>`_
  for more details.

For a full list of bug fixes and other improvements, see the
:doc:`/users/history`.
